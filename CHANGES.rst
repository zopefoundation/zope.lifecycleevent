==================

- Add convenience functions to parallel ``zope.lifecycleevent.modified``
  for the other events defined in this package.


3.6.2 (2010-09-25)
==================

- Add not declared, but needed test dependency on ``zope.component [test]``.

==================

- Remove dependency on undeclared ``zope.testing.doctest``.

3.6.0 (2009-12-29)
==================

==================

- Copy ``IObjectMovedEvent``, ``IObjectAddedEvent``,
  ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` interfaces and ``ObjectMovedEvent``,
  ``ObjectAddedEvent`` and ``ObjectRemovedEvent`` classes here
  from ``zope.container`` (plus tests).  The intent is to allow packages
  that rely on these interfaces or the event classes to rely on
  ``zope.lifecycleevent`` (which has few dependencies) instead of
  ``zope.container`` (which has many).

==================

- Remove old module declarations from classes.

- Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.
